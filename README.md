# Probability and Fitting Introduction
These codes introduce key concepts in Monte Carlo simulation, generating simulated data, and fitting models to data.

Each folder contains written materials as background, a python code that implements the concept, and some files and/or plots that are the results.

To run these codes on your local machine, open them in a text editor, and run them with ipython in a terminal. The anaconda environment (www.anaconda.com) is a great way to install a recent version of python 3 on your local machine if it is not already installed. VSCode (code.visualstudio.com) is a text editor that is both easy to use and modern. Both of these work on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Linux likely has a package manager that can install python and VSCode without needing anaconda, so for Linux this may be a better approach. Mac has the homebrew (https://brew.sh) system for installing general unix/linux tools, including and especially python.

My personal laptop runs Windows 11 and I use the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 to run the most recent Ubuntu LTS. I use the version of python that is included with Ubuntu, so I do not use anaconda, but I do use VSCode. This setup enables the speed and flexibility of linux while integrating fully into other Windows-only programs that are common in engineering and science.
